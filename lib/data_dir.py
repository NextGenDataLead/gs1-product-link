"""Where an installation keeps its data, as opposed to its code.

The code folder holds what a release ships: ``lib/``, ``scripts/``, ``ui/``, ``schema/``,
``reference/``, ``templates/``. The **data folder** holds what one installation owns and an
update must never touch: ``.env``, ``clients.yml``, ``input/`` and ``output/`` — and inside
``output/``, ``state.json``, the ledger of permanent GS1 writes.

By default the two are the same folder, which is how every installation before this module
worked, and nothing changes for them. Setting ``GS1_DATA_DIR`` separates them: the container
mounts its data at ``/data``, and an installer can put the data beside the user's documents so
that replacing the code folder cannot replace the ledger.

Every data path in this project is relative — ``Path("output") / client_id / …`` in code, and
``./input/…`` in ``clients.yml`` — so the data folder is simply the working directory. An entry
point calls :func:`enter_data_dir` from its ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` block, beside
:func:`lib.env.load_env` and for the same reason: tests call ``main()`` directly and must keep
their own working directory.
