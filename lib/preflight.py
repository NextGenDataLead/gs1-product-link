"""Eager, legible checks that a client is ready to run — the pure half of ``scripts/doctor``.

Every failure this module reports was previously a failure the operator met *late*. A missing
secret surfaced as :class:`~lib.errors.MissingCredentialError` at the first API call (E15), so
parse, plan and dry-run could all pass before it fired. A blank ``clients.yml`` field surfaced
as the first pydantic error and only the first. Generated copy that no longer matched the export
surfaced not at all: those units simply vanished from the plan (E21). The point of a preflight
is to move each of those to a moment where nothing is half-done and nothing is permanent.

Every check here is a function from configuration to a :class:`CheckResult`. None of them print,
none of them exit, and none of them write anything the pipeline reads — so a UI, a test, and the
CLI can all run the same checks and disagree only about how to display them.

**Nothing here calls** :func:`lib.state.load_state`. An idle peek at a corrupt state file
*quarantines* it (E19) — a side effect no diagnostic should have, and one that would make merely
looking at the system change what the next run does.

Two checks earn their place by guarding traps that are otherwise silent:

* :func:`check_generator` catches a ``generator`` block removed as unused cleanup. ``run_plan``
  derives ``require_generated_copy = cfg.generator is not None``, so deleting the block does not
  raise — it disables the E21 guard, and units with no copy publish with blank taglines instead
  of being held.
* :func:`check_generation_results` catches a run whose generated copy is missing or no longer
  matches the export. Copy is written fresh every run and never stored, so the question is not
  how much has accumulated but whether the file on disk answers every in-scope unit — and whether
  it still describes this export. The fingerprint covers ``{inputs, language, prompt_version}``,
  so any feed edit or version bump leaves those units uncovered, and an uncovered unit is an E21
  omission, which is to say invisible.
