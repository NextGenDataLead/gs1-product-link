"""Where an installed copy keeps its data, decided once per machine user and remembered.

A release is a folder of code: download it, unzip it, double-click the installer. The next release
is a *different* folder. The data — ``.env``, ``clients.yml``, ``input/``, ``output/`` and the
``state.json`` ledger of permanent GS1 writes — must outlive both, so it lives in a data folder of
its own (:mod:`lib.data_dir`), and a one-line **pointer** in the user's application-settings folder
records where. The installer decides and records; ``start`` reads.

The decision, in order:

1. **Remembered** — a pointer from an earlier install. Every later release uses the same data.
2. **Here** — this code folder already holds data: an installation from before data folders
   existed (the original Noviplast machine). It stays exactly where it is; the pointer just
   records it, so a later release unzipped elsewhere still finds it.
3. **New** — neither: a fresh folder in the user's home directory, seeded from the examples.

Two situations are refused rather than guessed, because each guess would be a second ledger:
the pointer names a folder that is gone, and both the pointer's folder and this one hold data.

Nothing here is ever deleted or overwritten. Seeding copies an example only where no file exists.
