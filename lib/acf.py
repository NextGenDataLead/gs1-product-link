"""Assemble the ACF field payload for one (product, language).

Some WordPress themes render a page from **ACF fields** rather than ``post_content`` —
Noviplast's Oxygen template is one, and its ``post_content`` is empty on every published
page. For those clients the Phase 5 model (render HTML into the body) produces a page that
returns 200, passes ``verify_url``, reports ``ok``, and shows the customer nothing. This
module supplies what such a client needs instead: a mapping from ACF field name to the
:class:`~lib.records.ProductRecord` field that feeds it.

The mapping lives in ``clients.yml`` (``wordpress.acf_map``), not here: field names are the
client's, and a tool that hardcodes ``product_title`` is a tool that only serves Noviplast.

See ``docs/clients/noviplast-page-adapter.md`` §3–§4.1 for how the fields were established
against the live site.
