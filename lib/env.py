"""Load ``.env`` into the process environment for command-line entry points.

``.env`` at the repository root is the single source of truth for credentials (OD-1,
``docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md``). Nothing used to load it: the secrets reached the code only
because Claude Code injected an ``env`` block from ``~/.claude/settings.json`` into every
command it ran, which meant a script run from a plain terminal could not reach GS1 at all.

``override=False`` keeps real environment variables winning over the file, so CI and any
deliberate one-off override still work.

**Call this from the ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` block of ``scripts/*.py`` — not from
``main()``.** Never at ``lib/`` import time either: a library must not have import side
effects.

The distinction between the ``__main__`` block and ``main()`` is load-bearing, not stylistic.
``.env`` carries all four variables that the staging guards gate on (``WP_STAGING_URL``,
``WP_STAGING_USER``, ``NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS``, ``STAGING_GTIN``), so anything that loads it
inside the test path arms tests that write to the live WordPress site and the GS1 production
resolver — the failure ``addopts = "-m 'not staging'"`` exists to prevent. Nine test modules
under ``tests/scripts/`` call ``main()`` directly, so a call sited there would load
production credentials into the pytest process on every plain ``pytest`` run. Sited in the
``__main__`` block, ``python -m scripts.run_plan`` loads ``.env`` and the tests never do.
