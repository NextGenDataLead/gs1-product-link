"""Typed exception hierarchy for the GS1 Digital Link Orchestrator.

Every module raises exceptions from this hierarchy rather than bare
``Exception`` (see ``docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`` §1 and §4.1). Callers can
catch :class:`OrchestratorError` to handle any tool-originated failure, or a
specific subclass for finer control.

**The three API errors put the failing call and the server's answer in their message.**
``run_execute`` records a failed row as ``repr(exc)``, so whatever is *not* in the message is
not in ``runs/*.jsonl`` — and the run log is the only durable per-row record this tool keeps.
For a long time the message was the status code alone, which is how a live ``403`` came to be
recorded as ``WordPressAPIError('WordPress API error 403')``: the HTML naming the culprit went
to a console nobody has on a scheduled run, and the row never said *which* of a page write, an
ACF write and two media uploads had failed. Diagnosing that cost hours and one wrong conclusion.

The body is scrubbed by :func:`lib.logging_setup.scrub_response_body` and bounded by
:data:`ERROR_BODY_LIMIT` before it goes anywhere near the message; ``response_body`` still holds
the raw text for programmatic inspection.
