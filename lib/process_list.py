"""Process list: the operator's explicit list of which GTINs a run may touch.

Loads the operator-maintained control file — ``input/{client_id}/process/selection/
selections.xlsx``, at whatever path ``process_list.path`` names — and
returns the set of GTINs in it. **Every GTIN in the file is processed.** There is no
eligibility logic here and no interpretation of cell *values* — the file is a list, and
being on it is the whole meaning.

That is deliberate, and it replaced a version that read "already on website" and "already
in GS1" columns with presence-semantics (any non-blank cell meant ``True``). The old
behaviour was correct only for files that mark rows with ``X``: a client whose file said
``no`` got the opposite of what the word meant, silently, because ``"no"`` is non-blank.
It failed in both directions — a wrong "on website" emptied the plan and the run reported
success having published nothing, while a wrong "in GS1" marked a product eligible and
pointed the pipeline at a GTIN with no resolver record. Neither raised anything.

So the judgement moved to the person who has it. **The operator prepares the file by
deleting every row that should not be processed**, by whatever rule their business uses.
The tool no longer guesses what a column means, because it no longer reads one.

The file is read by :mod:`lib.xlsx` rather than ``openpyxl``, for reasons that are all
properties of the files real clients send — Strict Open XML, a table that does not start at
A1, a sheet that is not the first one. That reader lived here until the client's video
sign-off sheet needed the same treatment; its docstring carries the full account. What stays
here is what is specific to *this* file: the header is found by the configured GTIN column,
and GTINs are normalised to 14 digits so a 13-digit barcode joins to a 14-digit
:attr:`lib.records.ProductRecord.gtin14`.

There is one reader, not two. :func:`read_process_list` returns the whole table as a
:class:`ProcessListSheet` — the shape an editing surface needs — and
:func:`load_process_list` is that call plus ``listed_gtins()``. The shell used to carry its
own openpyxl reader, which meant a Strict-OOXML file with a title row loaded in a run and
failed on screen; the two could disagree about the same file, and did.
