"""The sections only the complete data-quality report has. Pure.

Operator, 2026-10-08: the report "needs to give a complete insight into all missing data/video's,
data to be adjusted, etc. So an actionable report." The batch report on the Data screen answers
for the products being worked on; this one answers for **every product the client sent and
everything that is live**, and adds what no per-product section can show:

* **where every product stands** — live (and, per page, whether the site shows its video and its
  text), ready to publish, held and why, or not in the export at all;
* **what is wrong with the product list itself** — barcodes the export does not carry, and one
  barcode on several rows (7 Days and Fun Grill share one; the export says it is the grill);
* **who does what** — a table of jobs by owner, each pointing at the section with the detail.

The site is the authority on a live page. A page the site could not be asked about is "not
checked", never "video · text": a report that guesses in the reassuring direction is the failure
this whole project is arranged against. ``scripts/report_quality --complete`` does the reading.
