"""§1 of the data-quality report: which selected products are waiting on a video, and on what.

**Why it is early.** A product held for want of a video is not published at all — in any language,
with a run that reports success — and on the pilot that is 48 of 110. It was spread across three
places that never met: §0 showed a ○ per product, the Summary counted the hold, and a "backlog"
section near the end listed filenames. "118 video files have no GTIN" and "40 GTINs have no
confirmed video" sat in one document and left the reader to notice the numbers do not meet in the
middle — because they cannot. A file with no barcode names no product.

**So the section has four parts, and says which side each is on.**

* **1a** is the product side: one row per held product and what it is waiting on. Unbounded,
  because each row is a job the client can do.
* **1b** is the products with two videos confirmed in one language — the tool attaches neither.
* **1c** is the file side: videos with no barcode yet. Sampled, because a filename that names no
  product is a status line, and ``mapping.yml`` is where the whole list lives. That asymmetry with
  1a is deliberate and the section says so.
* **1d** is the client's sign-off sheet, re-planned against the mapping on every render, so what
  it still says is always current. It is the one thing that joins the two sides.

Pure: no config, no I/O, no clock. :mod:`scripts.report_quality` gathers the inputs.
