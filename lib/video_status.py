"""Which in-scope products have a video in each language, and which videos have no product yet.

The join nothing else makes. :mod:`lib.media_video` is about the mapping file, keyed
``(language, file)``, and leaves a gap's ``gtin`` blank on purpose: a file nobody has assigned names
no product. :mod:`lib.holds` is keyed by publishable unit and stops at the first rule that holds
it, so it cannot say *which* language is missing. :mod:`lib.preflight` speaks in
``CheckResult``\\ s. So the sentence a client can act on — *this selected product is held, and it is
waiting on a French video* — had no producer, and somebody hand-made a file of that shape instead.

**What stops this being one more opinion about the hold.** There were six computations of it.
Here, a language counts as having a video exactly when :meth:`lib.media_video.VideoMap.resolve`
returns a file for it — the method ``run_execute`` calls to attach one. :data:`MISSING` and
:data:`CLASHING` only split that method's ``None`` in two, by the same canonical count
:func:`lib.media_video.check_video_map` reports ambiguity with. "Has a video here" and "gets a
video on the page" cannot drift apart, because the first is defined by the second.

**Held is the gate's word, and only the gate's.** :func:`lib.media_video.fully_mapped_gtins`
decides what may publish: a product with exactly one confirmed video in every language. So
:attr:`VideoStatus.held` is the products that do not attach a video everywhere — :data:`MISSING`
*or* :data:`CLASHING` in some language — which is that rule exactly, pinned by a test against it.
The gate used to admit a GTIN confirmed to two files in one language, which then published with no
video there; it holds one now, and :attr:`VideoStatus.clashing` is the subset the report names
with both filenames, so one can be marked ``skip``.

Pure: no config, no file I/O, no clock. The caller loads the mapping and lists the folders.
