"""Start a batch fresh: set this batch's live inputs aside, so the Data screen is empty again.

The shell remembers everything between sittings — it reads the batch from disk — so "start over"
used to mean finding three files by hand. This moves them, and only them:

* the **selection** a run reads (``process/selection/selections.xlsx``),
* the **uploaded list** it was chosen from (``process/uploads/product-list.xlsx``),
* the **GS1 export** a run reads (``process/uploads/GS1 export/export.xlsx``),
* the **parsed products** the export was read into (``output/{client}/data/products.json``) — left
  behind, it would keep every other screen describing the export just set aside.

**Moved, never deleted**, into ``input/{client}/superseded/cleared-{stamp}/`` with a note saying
what happened. ``input/`` is gitignored, so a delete cannot be undone; and each of the three inputs
already has a dated copy beside it (archived on the way in), so the move loses nothing a person
could want back.

**Deliberately untouched:** every dated archive, the video mapping (the client's sign-off — weeks of
work, and not part of any one batch), the sign-off sheets, ``state.json``, generated copy, the run
folders, and anything live. A fresh batch is a new *intention*; none of those is one.
