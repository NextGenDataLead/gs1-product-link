"""The video→GTIN candidate report: one row per (language, file), with what it might be.

``build_video_map --check`` answers "where are the gaps" and writes JSON. This answers the
question the *client* has to settle — "which product is this video of?" — as a grid they can work
in. A product is held out of every run until it has a confirmed video in each language
(``media.restrict_to_mapped_gtins``), so the mapping is the input that decides how much of a batch
can publish at all, and confirming a row is the client's call rather than the tool's.

Rows are the **union** of the mapping and the folders, so ``on disk, unmapped`` and ``mapped, file
missing`` are both visible; a mapping read against an absent video library would otherwise report
a clean file as a wall of missing ones. Scoring is not re-implemented here — every candidate comes
from :func:`lib.media_video.rank_candidates` over :func:`lib.media_video.normalize_video_name`, so
this report and the shell's suggestions cannot come to disagree about what matches.

Two things the columns exist to say, both of which cost a day to find out:

* **``product_name`` is the wrong name to show on its own.** Attribute 3301 is the short generic
  one — ``bezem``, ``siliconenbak``. What identifies a product to somebody looking at a video file
  is in the ``marketing_name`` / ``logistics_name`` extras: ``Noviplast Afvoerreinigingsstick
  afbreekbaar geel``, ``Drain Sticks 12pc``. All three are emitted, in every configured language.
* **The winning field is often a French one.** On the pilot feed 103 of 173 rows scored best
  against a ``.fr`` field, because the filenames are English and this feed's English sits in the
  French slots — ``logistics_name.fr`` is ``Drain Sticks 12pc`` on one GTIN and ``Bâton`` on
  another. So the value that scored and the field it came from are columns of their own: without
  them a 0.93 beside an unrecognisable Dutch name reads as a bug rather than as the answer.

Pure and deterministic — no filesystem, no config, no clock. ``scripts/report_video_candidates.py``
does the I/O and chooses the file format.
