"""Which products the plan will hold, asked before there is a plan — E23, E24, E22.

Three of the plan's skip rules drop a **whole product** rather than one unit, and none of them
depends on prior state or on generated copy: mandatory source data missing (E23), no
client-confirmed video in every language (E24), and a blank hero image (E22). That makes them
decidable from configuration, the parsed products and the video map alone — which is what lets a
caller running *before* the plan ask "will this product be skipped whatever I do?" and stop paying
for work nobody will read.

``run_generate`` is that caller. It asked a producer for every in-scope unit a run would create or
change, and on the pilot client that was **74 units across 37 GTINs of which 10 GTINs could
publish** — 17 held for want of a confirmed video, 10 for missing mandatory data. So ~73% of the
batch was copy for products the plan then skipped. That is the failure ``run_generate._prepare``
already records one gate earlier ("224 requests emitted where 10 were in scope"): real tokens spent
on products nobody is publishing, and a content-review gate three times larger than the work in it,
which is the surest way to make a review gate go unread.

**Every predicate here is the plan's own.** :func:`lib.mandatory.missing_mandatory` over
:attr:`~lib.config.ExportConfig.all_sources` for E23, :class:`lib.media_video.VideoGate`
for E24, and the same blank-``image_url`` test for E22. A hand-rolled second opinion about what
``required`` means is exactly how "E23 means blank dimensions" came to be believed, and E23 decides
whether a SKU may publish at all. :func:`lib.state.diff_against_state` still *applies* these rules;
this module says what they are going to decide.

**E23 is asked of what generation cannot fix.** The plan runs its mandatory check on the
*post-generation* records, so a value the feed carries in one language and the client has marked
``translate: true`` is no longer a gap by the time E23 is reached — the producer fills it. Asking
the pre-generation record alone would hold exactly the units whose gap the generation was going to
close, and a unit held for want of copy nobody was asked to write is a page that never publishes.
So a gap counts here only when :func:`lib.generator.translation_gaps` — the same function that
decides what the producer is asked to translate — offers nothing to derive it from.

**E18 and E21 are deliberately absent**, for the reason :func:`lib.state.classify_units` gives:
both are per unit and both sit downstream of generation. E21 holds a unit with no generated
tagline, which before generation is every unit; E18 holds a language with no ``product_name``,
which is one of the values the producer supplies. Asked here, each would hold the unit that was
about to close it.

Nothing here reads ``state.json``, so an idle call cannot quarantine a corrupt one (E19).
