"""Writing the client's issue report — :mod:`lib.issue_report` — as a PDF and an Excel workbook.

Same content, two forms (operator, 2026-10-09): the PDF to read and forward, the workbook to filter
and work through. Both carry the three parts in the same order — the total, the issues by category,
the failed products — so whichever one the client opens, the numbers agree.

The PDF uses the core Helvetica font, which carries Latin-1 only. Product names in Dutch and French
fit; the few typographic marks this tool writes (—, ·, …, quotes) are swapped for plain ones
rather than refused, so no report ever fails to build over a dash.
