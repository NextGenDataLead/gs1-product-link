"""Which mandatory source values a product is missing — the E23 hold, as a pure function.

A page assembled from an incomplete record is worse than no page: it publishes, the QR resolves,
and the product looks finished until someone reads it. So a SKU missing any mandatory value is held
out of the plan entirely rather than published thin, and the gap is *reported* — the fix belongs in
MyGS1, never downstream. ``docs/setup.md`` states the invariant: never invent product data.

**The hold is per product, not per language.** A localised field must carry a value in every
configured language, and a product missing one language is held in all of them. The alternative —
publishing nl while fr is missing — leaves a SKU half-live, which reads as success on every surface
that counts pages.

Mandatory-ness is declared in ``clients.yml`` on each ``gdsn_map`` entry, not hard-coded here:
which fields a client's page cannot do without is a property of that client's template.
``required_group`` covers the either-or case — Noviplast's generator writes from attr 1083 *or*
1067 and needs only one, so neither is individually mandatory but the pair is.

Nothing here reads a file, and it never mutates a record.
