"""Where a run's own files live, and how to find them again.

A run produces three documents that describe it: the log of what it did to each row, the selection
it consumed, and the per-row result sheet. They used to live in three different shapes — a flat
``runs/{ts}.jsonl``, a file in ``input/`` that the run merely read, and a workbook written by hand
from another screen days later — and the consequence was that **nothing on disk could distinguish
an intention from a record**. The pair of files in ``input/`` sat there after the operator quit
mid-batch, looking exactly like a run that had happened.

So each run owns a directory, and the things that describe it are written *by it, into that
directory*. ``input/`` then means one thing only: what the **next** run will use. Quitting
mid-batch leaves an intention in ``input/`` and nothing in ``runs/``, which is precisely true.

**Both layouts are read.** The flat ``runs/{ts}.jsonl`` predates this and the operator has weeks of
them; a reader that saw only the new shape would report their history as empty, which is the
loudest possible way to look broken. Writing only ever uses the new shape.
