"""Multilingual plugin adapters for the WordPress client (§4.5).

WordPress sites localise content through one of several plugins. The orchestrator
publishes one page per (GTIN, language) and then links those pages as translations of
one another; *how* that link is expressed is plugin-specific. This module isolates that
difference behind :class:`MultilingualAdapter` so ``lib.wp_client.WordPressClient`` stays
plugin-agnostic.

v0.1.0 supports Polylang, WPML, and a no-op for single-language sites.

WPML exposes no core REST route for language assignment or translation linking, so
:class:`WPMLAdapter` calls a small site-side helper (a Code Snippet / mu-plugin) that wraps
WPML's PHP API. That route is deliberately shaped like Polylang's ``/pll/v1/translations``
so both adapters stay symmetric. See ``docs/clients/noviplast-page-adapter.md`` §7 for the
helper's source and the live verification.

    WPML publishes no core REST route for assigning a post's language or linking a set of

    (a Code Snippet / mu-plugin; source and live verification in

    The response's ``translations`` is read back from WPML's own tables rather than echoed,
    so this adapter **asserts it matches what was sent**. A silent no-op — the failure mode
    this integration is most prone to — then surfaces here rather than as a page that looks
    published but is unreachable in its own language.
