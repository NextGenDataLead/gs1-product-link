"""The operator gates, as data — one source for the skill's prose and any UI that renders them.

The gates are the safety mechanism of this project. ``CLAUDE.md`` says it outright: they live in
``.claude/skills/flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md``, and calling ``scripts/run_execute.py`` directly
bypasses every one of them. Only two guards are in code — the production refusal and the
``--only links`` target-serves check — and both are there *because prose can be skipped*.

That is fine while a language model reading the prose is the only thing driving the pipeline. The
moment a second consumer exists — a form-rendering UI, a test, a checklist — there are two
implementations of one safety contract, and two implementations drift. Silently, because a gate
that quietly stops being shown raises nothing.

So the contract lives here, and both consumers read it. ``SKILL.md`` keeps the verbatim prompt text
a model needs; this module keeps the *structure*: which gates exist, at which step, which are
non-negotiable, and which apply in which mode. ``SKILL.md`` also carries a **Gate index** table
listing every id, and ``tests/lib/test_gates.py`` asserts the two agree in **both directions** — so
adding a gate here without documenting it there, or the reverse, fails CI rather than diverging
quietly.

This module also owns :func:`run_execute_argv`. The command is part of the contract: ``--only``
comes from the intent gate and ``--i-understand-production`` from the production gate, and getting
either wrong turns a reviewed decision into an unreviewed write. A UI that builds its own argv is a
second chance to get it wrong.

Nothing here executes anything, prompts anything, or reads a file.

    from the word, because the inference is not obvious in any direction: ``changed-review``
    advances and ``switch-to-test`` does not, and both read like the opposite at a glance. A UI
    that guesses wrong here either blocks a legitimate run or — far worse — treats ``cancel`` as
    consent.

    It was a ``proceeds`` boolean until that boolean was found to be answering two questions with
    one bit. ``show-full-diff`` is where they part: in the chat flow it prints the rest of the diff
    and re-prompts, so *does not advance* is true of it, and the flag was set accordingly. On a
    form surface it is the **terminal** answer to its gate, so the same flag read as a refusal —
    and since it is the only option the shell can render at that gate, the single button on the
    card cancelled the run irrecoverably, on the path taken by the operator doing the most careful
    thing on offer. Two states made a screen guess; three say which question is being asked.

    ``chat_only`` marks an option only the conversational surface can honour, and it is data for
    the same reason ``outcome`` is: a UI cannot infer it. It is a **separate axis** — *which
    surface can honour this*, not a fourth value of *what this does*. Two gates carry such options
    — one needs a model to read the run log and explain, the others need a row-by-row walk the
    shell does not do. Deleting them instead would have been the tail wagging the dog: the shell
    cannot do a thing, so the surface that can loses it, and ``SKILL.md`` has to be edited to
    match. This keeps both surfaces honest about what they offer, and lets the contract test derive
    what a screen must render rather than carrying a hand-maintained list of exceptions.

    The command *is* part of the gate contract, so it is built once rather than twice.

    * ``--only`` is appended for ``pages`` and ``links`` and omitted for ``both``, because
      omitting it is what ``both`` means — every invocation written before ``--only`` existed
      keeps its behaviour.
    * ``--i-understand-production`` is appended **only** when the production gate has been
      answered, and never on a dry run, which needs no acknowledgement because it writes nothing.
      Passing it earlier would hand a real run the authorisation before anyone granted it; the
      flag exists precisely so that the live write is a deliberate act.

    ``production_acknowledged`` is a positive statement — "someone confirmed" — rather than an
    ``is_production`` fact, so the flag cannot be derived from configuration alone. Deriving it
    would make it a description of the environment instead of a record of a decision.

    Args:
        client_id: The client to run.
        mode: The leg confirmed at gate 0.
        confirmed_path: Path to the ``ConfirmedPlan`` JSON.
        dry_run: Whether this is the mandatory preview (gate 8.5) rather than the real run.
        production_acknowledged: Whether the production gate (step 8) was answered ``confirm``.
        revive: Whether to re-publish GTINs that ``run_unpublish`` took down.

    Returns:
        The full argv, starting at the module name — ``["python", "-m", …]`` is the caller's job,
        since it owns the interpreter.
