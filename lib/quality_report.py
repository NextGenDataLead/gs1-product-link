"""Render the four per-step issue reports into one human-readable markdown worklist.

The pipeline writes several machine-readable issue files
(``source_issues.json``, ``generated_issues.json``, ``video_map_issues.json``,
``category_issues.json``) — each a flat list of :class:`~lib.records.SourceIssue`. This module
folds them into a single report grouped by **owner and action** (what blocks publishing, what a
human must review, what the client fixes in MyGS1), so the operator has one thing to read and hand
off rather than four JSON files.

Pure and deterministic: :func:`render_quality_report` takes already-parsed inputs (including the
snapshot date and per-source freshness) and returns markdown. All I/O and clock access live in
``scripts/report_quality.py``, so the same inputs render byte-identically and the renderer is unit
-testable without touching the filesystem. Each section is built by a small ``_*_lines`` helper.
