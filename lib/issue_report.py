"""The short issue report for the client: which products of a batch failed, and why.

Operator, 2026-10-09: the data-quality report "has gotten a bit out of hand" — the client needs a
one-to-two pager, about **the selected products only**, saying

1. how many products failed;
2. the issues by category, each with its products and the reason;
3. the failed products, each with its reasons — the same facts as (2), the other way round.

There are two moments it is asked for, and this module builds both:

* **before a run** — :func:`selection_issues`, from the Data screen's verdict over the *ticked*
  rows, so the report says exactly what the screen says (``lib.eligibility`` is the one producer);
* **after a run** — :func:`run_issues`, from the per-run result rows (``lib.scope_report``): what
  the plan held, what failed while publishing, and what went live without a video. Only the
  products the run was given; the rows the operator left unticked are not this report's business.

A **missing video** is listed as an issue but is not a failure: the product runs, and goes live
without the video (operator, 2026-10-09). Everything else here stops the product, or part of it.

Pure: no filesystem, no clock, no config. :mod:`lib.issue_report_files` writes the PDF and Excel.
