"""Per-client run state: persistence, atomic writes, and content hashing.

Implements ``docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`` §4.8. State records, per
``(GTIN, language)``, the WordPress page id/URL, the featured-media id, the
content and GS1 link-set hashes, and the last-run timestamp — enough for
``scripts/run_execute.py`` to run idempotently and for change detection between
runs. The state models themselves (:class:`~lib.records.State`,
:class:`~lib.records.StateEntry`) live in ``lib/records.py``; this module is the
persistence/logic layer over them.

``save_state`` is **atomic**: it writes to a temporary file in the destination
directory and ``os.replace``s it into place, so a crash mid-write leaves the
previous ``state.json`` intact rather than a truncated file (§12 Phase 6 DoD).
``load_state`` recovers from a corrupt file rather than aborting (edge E19) — see its
docstring for why that is safe and what the caller must surface.

``diff_against_state`` (§4.8) classifies each ``(GTIN, language)`` against prior
state — NEW / UNCHANGED / CHANGED by content hash — and builds the ``PlanRow`` list
that ``scripts/run_plan.py`` writes to ``plan.json``. Its signature takes the whole
:class:`~lib.config.WordPressConfig` rather than §4.8's bare ``target_url_pattern``,
because building a ``PlanRow`` needs the slug pattern, site URL, post type, and
default language too — all of which live on that config. It returns a
:class:`PlanDiff`, not a bare list: the units it *drops* (E18/E21/E22) are as much of
its answer as the ones it keeps, and while they were only a warning log every caller
threw them away.

    :class:`~lib.records.StateEntry`: no entry → NEW, equal hash → UNCHANGED, else
    CHANGED (carrying a ``title`` and/or ``target_url`` diff for whichever of those
    moved). An entry whose page was published without a resolver link is CHANGED whatever
    its hash says, and one that was deliberately taken down is HELD — see
    :func:`_classify`. A language with no ``product_name`` for a product is omitted with a warning
    (edge E18) rather than emitting a row with a missing title.

    **E21 is asked after the classification, and only of a row that will be written.** When
    ``require_generated_copy`` is set, a NEW or CHANGED unit with no generated tagline is omitted

    silently-blank page. An UNCHANGED or HELD unit is not asked at all: copy is written per run for
    the rows a run executes, and those two are never executed (``ui/pages/publish.py`` confirms
    neither, and ``run_execute`` drops HELD regardless), so arriving without copy is what correct
    looks like for them. Asked before the classification, as it was until copy stopped being
    stored, E21 could not tell "nothing was written for this" from "nothing needed to be" — and
    reported every already-live page as a work item. The gap that E21 *does* catch is still
    reported upstream by ``merge_generated`` (``missing_generation_input``); this skip only keeps
    it out of the actionable plan.

    **What the hash is allowed to notice.** By default the hash covers the record it is given,
    whole. A caller that has enriched its records with language-model output — generated copy,
    or a language gap filled by translating the sibling — passes the pre-enrichment records as
    ``hash_source``, and the classification is computed from those instead. Model output is not
    stable across runs: regenerate over unchanged feed data and the wording moves, so a hash that
    covered it would reclassify every page CHANGED and rewrite the whole site having changed
    nothing. The enriched record is still what the row carries and what gets rendered; only the
    *comparison* ignores the parts a model wrote.

            generator-less clients.
        require_hero_image: When True (``media.require_hero_image``), hold any GTIN whose source
            ``image_url`` is blank so a hero-less page is never published (E22). Off by default; a
            runtime image fetch failure still degrades gracefully and publishes (E7).
        gdsn_map: The client's ``export.gdsn_map``. When given, a product missing any value marked
            ``required`` — or every member of a ``required_group`` — is held in **all** languages
            (E23), because a page assembled from an incomplete record publishes and looks finished.
            The hold is per product on purpose: publishing nl while fr is missing leaves a SKU
            half-live, which reads as success on every surface that counts pages.
        video_gtins: GTIN-14s with a client-confirmed video in every language. When given, a
            product outside it is held in all languages (E24). Passing the set rather than the
            video map keeps this function free of file reading, and lets the caller decide what
            "confirmed" means.
        hash_source: The records that *define* the content, keyed by GTIN, when they differ from
            the records being planned — see "What the hash is allowed to notice" above. Must cover
            every planned product: a partial mapping is a caller bug, and raising a ``KeyError``
            on it beats silently hashing the enriched record for the one GTIN that was forgotten,
            which would reclassify exactly that row and nothing else. Defaults to ``None``, which
            hashes each product itself.

    Returns:
        A :class:`PlanDiff`: one :class:`~lib.records.PlanRow` per planned
        ``(GTIN, language)`` in input order, and one
        :class:`~lib.records.SkippedUnit` per unit dropped by E18/E21/E22. The two are
        returned together, rather than the skips being left to a warning log the caller may
        or may not read, because a plan that silently lost every row is the failure this
        function is most able to cause.

    Raises:
        ConfigError: If ``wordpress.slug_pattern`` or ``wordpress.target_url_pattern``
            is unset — both are required to build a plan.
