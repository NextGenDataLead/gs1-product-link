"""Canonical record schema and export-row parsing.

Implements ``docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`` §2 (type definitions) and §4.9
(``parse_excel_row``). :class:`ProductRecord` is the normalised, language-agnostic
internal shape produced by ``scripts/parse_export.py`` and consumed by every
downstream module (templates, WordPress client, GS1 client, QR, state).

The client-specific *bridge* from a raw export to this shape lives in the column
mapping (§3): for flat single-sheet exports here in :func:`parse_excel_row`, and
for GS1 Data Source / GDSN datapool exports in ``lib/gdsn.py`` (a spec extension —

    titles were persisted have none; ``None`` means "not recorded", and the diff omits
    the title rather than guessing an old value.

    ``wp_status`` and ``gs1_enabled`` record whether the product is actually *reachable*,

    Both default to the published condition so state files written before they existed
    load unchanged, the same back-compat move ``title`` makes. ``gs1_enabled`` describes
    the GTIN, not the language, but is stored per-language because state is keyed
    ``(gtin, language)`` — mirroring ``gs1_link_set_hash``, which is already duplicated
    across an entry's languages for exactly that reason.

    An **empty** ``gs1_link_set_hash`` means "page published, resolver link never written"
    — what ``run_execute --only pages`` leaves behind. It is a real value, not a missing
    one: ``lib.state._classify`` reads it and reports the row CHANGED so the links half can
