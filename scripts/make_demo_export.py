"""Write the synthetic GS1 Data Source export the example client never had.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.make_demo_export [CLIENT_ID] [--config PATH] [--dry-run] [--force]

Builds a GDSN datapool workbook and a product scope list from :mod:`lib.demo_export` and writes
each to the path that client's config declares — ``export.path`` and ``process_list.path``. With a
``media`` block it also writes the videos from :mod:`lib.demo_videos`: a placeholder file per
mapping row into ``media.video_folders``, ``mapping.yml`` at ``media.video_map_path``, and the
client's sign-off sheet under ``test-uploads/``, where an operator rehearsing the Data screen picks
it up — so every video state the screen and the report distinguish can be rehearsed without a real
client. The
paths come from the config rather than from a flag because that is the only place the rest of the
tool will look: an export written anywhere else is invisible to it, which is the single most
common way a run quietly uses the wrong data.

**Why this exists.** The operator shell's Data screen needs both an export and a scope list before
it renders anything, and ``democlient`` had no export that ``parse_export`` could read. So every
rehearsal of that screen was driven against the live client — and uploading through the picker
replaces the control file in place, which corrupted a real operator's scope list three times.
This command is what makes a throwaway client a real option.

Defaults to ``clients.example.yml``, which is where ``democlient`` is defined; the operator's own
``clients.yml`` is gitignored and holds their real client, not this one.

**It will not overwrite an existing file without ``--force``.** The damage this command could do
is to write demo products over a client's real export, and the only reliable sign of that target
is that something is already there.

Exit codes:
    0  written (or, with --dry-run, validated)
    1  refused — a target file exists and --force was not given
    2  config errors (bad client id, unreadable config, no export/process_list path)
