"""Check that a client is ready to publish, before anything irreversible is attempted.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.doctor [CLIENT_ID] [--offline] [--json] [--config PATH]

``CLIENT_ID`` may be omitted when ``clients.yml`` defines exactly one client.

Runs every check in :mod:`lib.preflight` and prints them as a list an operator can work
down. The checks themselves are pure and live there; this script is the argument parsing,
the ``.env`` load, and the rendering.

The point is *when* it runs. Credentials were previously resolved lazily, so a
:class:`~lib.errors.MissingCredentialError` fired at the first API call — an operator could
complete parse, plan and a clean dry-run before discovering a secret was missing. Coverage gaps
were worse: a generated-copy cache that no longer matched the export produced no error at all,
just units quietly absent from the plan (E21).

``--offline`` stops before any check that reads a credential or opens a socket, which is also
what makes it safe to run anywhere. Everything it skips is reported as skipped rather than
silently dropped — a report that shows fewer lines without saying so is the failure mode this
tool exists to prevent.

Nothing here writes anything the pipeline reads, and nothing calls ``load_state``: an idle peek
at a corrupt state file *quarantines* it (E19), and a diagnostic must not change what the next
run does.

Exit codes:
    0  every applicable check passed (warnings do not fail the run)
    1  at least one check failed — this is a finding, not a crash; the report is on stdout
    2  usage error (unreadable --config path is a *finding*, not a usage error)
