"""Compare the live site against ``state.json`` and report where they disagree.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.reconcile [CLIENT_ID] [--json]

``CLIENT_ID`` may be omitted when ``clients.yml`` defines exactly one client.

``state.json`` is what every run classifies from, and nothing has ever checked it against the
site. The divergence is not hypothetical and does not need anyone to have edited anything by
hand: **a run that fails part-way creates it.** One product published in Dutch and failed on
French; sibling-blocking correctly held the product, so the row was logged as an error and
nothing was written to state — while the Dutch page was live and publicly reachable. Ten entries
in the ledger, eleven tool-made pages on the site, and no way to find out.

This lists every page carrying a ``meta.gtin`` per configured language, diffs it against the
ledger in both directions, and prints what it finds.

**Read-only, and deliberately so.** Only ``GET`` requests, and it reads state through
:func:`lib.state.peek_state` rather than ``load_state`` — the latter *quarantines* a corrupt
file (E19), which would make an idle diagnostic change what the next run does. It reports and
never repairs: each divergence has more than one correct resolution, and choosing needs someone
who knows which machine published last.

Exit codes:
    0  the site and the ledger agree
    1  at least one divergence — a finding, not a crash; the report is on stdout
    2  usage/config error, or the site could not be read
