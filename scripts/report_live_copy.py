"""Ask the live site which products still have no tagline or Eigenschappen text.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.report_live_copy [CLIENT_ID] [--json]

``CLIENT_ID`` may be omitted when ``clients.yml`` defines exactly one client.

Every other "does this need copy?" in this pipeline is answered from ``state.json``. That ledger
records what *this machine* wrote, and it does not travel: two machines publish, two ledgers
diverge, and neither can say what is on the site. This asks the site.

For each product on the process list it reports one of four states:

* **has text** — live in every configured language, with every generated field populated;
* **needs text** — a page missing, or live with a blank generated field, and the export carries
  something to write copy from;
* **no inputs** — the same, but the export carries neither attr 1083 nor attr 1067, so nothing on
  this machine can supply it. That is a MyGS1 worklist, not a Generate button;
* **held** — the plan will hold it (missing mandatory data, the video gate, no image), so the site
  is not consulted for it. These are the rows the Data screen shows without a tick box; the saved
  selection keeps them only so a run can name them, and they must not read as chosen here.

What it deliberately does **not** answer is whether the inputs *changed* since the live text was
written. That needs a fingerprint of the published unit, which is exactly the ledger this exists
to stop depending on — so it is the operator's call, made by picking products to regenerate.

**Two requests per language to list, then one per page to read.** The listing is language-scoped
and its ``acf`` payload is empty on a WPML site (measured: all thirteen French pages read as
textless while rendering their text correctly), so every page is re-read by id with no ``lang``
parameter. That is the only read that tells the truth — see :meth:`lib.wp_client.read_page`.

**Read-only.** GETs and nothing else, and it reads no state at all.

Emits (--json): the report on stdout, for the operator shell to parse.
Exit codes:
    0  the site was read
    2  config error, or the site could not be read
