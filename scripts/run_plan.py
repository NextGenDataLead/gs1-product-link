"""Build a run plan by classifying products against prior state (IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §8.2).

Usage:
    python -m scripts.run_plan CLIENT_ID [--include-published] [--products PATH]

Loads the client config, its persisted state, and the parsed products, then classifies
each ``(GTIN, language)`` as NEW / UNCHANGED / CHANGED (``lib.state.diff_against_state``)
and writes the resulting :class:`~lib.records.Plan` to ``output/{client_id}/plan.json``.

When the client configures a ``process_list``, products are first gated to the GTINs on
that list — **every GTIN in the file is processed**, and every product not on it is
excluded and reported in the summary. The list carries no status columns and the tool
interprets no cell values: the operator prepares it by deleting the rows that should not
run. Without a ``process_list`` config, every product is planned (the plain spec
behaviour).

    --products:   default output/{client_id}/data/products.json

A *corrupt* state file is not fatal (E19): ``load_state`` moves it aside and starts fresh,
and the summary leads with a warning — every row then re-plans as NEW, which is idempotent
to execute but rewrites live pages and resolver targets. An *unreadable* one still exits 2.

Everything the run concluded but did not put *in* the plan — the gate exclusions, the tally
of units dropped before classification, the E19 reset and where the corrupt file went — is
also written to ``plan.summary.json``, and the stderr line is carried in it verbatim. It used
to exist only as prose on a stream, so the only reader that could ever see it was the process
that ran the command.

Emits:  output/{client_id}/plan.json (a Plan as JSON)
        output/{client_id}/plan.summary.json (a PlanSummary as JSON, always)
Exit codes:
    0  plan written
    2  config/state error (bad client id, unreadable products/state/control file,
       missing slug/target_url patterns)

    """Drop GTINs that are already finished (§9.5), unless ``include_published``.

    **``include_published`` exists because "finished" is an assumption, not a fact.** A product
    whose source data changes after it goes live is not finished, and this gate removed it before
    classification — so the plan came back empty and a run reported success having written
    nothing. That is indistinguishable from "there was nothing to do". The flag re-admits those
    GTINs and lets :func:`lib.state.diff_against_state` decide: an untouched product still
    classifies UNCHANGED and is never executed, so the flag widens what is *considered*, not what
    is published.

    It is deliberately not the default. Re-planning finished products makes a routine run capable
    of rewriting live pages, which the operator must choose rather than inherit — and every
    surface that reports a plan says the flag was used (see :class:`~lib.records.PlanSummary`).

    A no-op unless ``media.restrict_to_mapped_gtins``. Extends the tally with ``already_present``
    (published *and* resolvable). ``run_execute`` hard-enforces the mapped-only rule independently,
    so a ``--plan`` slice can still update an already-present pilot GTIN.

    **It no longer drops GTINs that lack a confirmed video.** That was a silent exclusion: the
    product vanished before classification, so it appeared in no plan, no skip list and no report —
    indistinguishable from a product nobody had asked about. Those GTINs now reach
    :func:`lib.state.diff_against_state` and are *held* there (E24), which puts them in
    ``PlanDiff.skipped`` and therefore in the data-quality report, where the missing video can be
    acted on. Same products excluded from publishing; the difference is that the operator can see
    which, and why.

    **"Finished" means published *and* resolvable, not merely having a state entry.** A
    ``run_execute --only pages`` run writes an entry whose ``gs1_link_set_hash`` is empty — the
    page is live but no Digital Link points at it, which :func:`lib.state._has_no_resolver_link`
    reports CHANGED so a follow-up ``--only links`` has something to plan. Treating any entry as
    finished dropped those GTINs here, *before* classification ran, so the row never reached
    ``_classify`` and the plan came back empty: a ``pages`` run silently removed its own GTIN from
    every subsequent plan and the two-step flow could not complete. Requiring a link-set hash in
    every language keeps a half-published GTIN in the queue until its resolver record exists.
    Entries written before ``--only`` existed all carry a real hash, so no prior state reclassifies.
