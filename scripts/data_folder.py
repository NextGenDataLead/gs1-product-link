"""Decide, record and report this installation's data folder (:mod:`lib.install_location`).

Called by the double-click scripts, never by an operator directly:

    python -m scripts.data_folder --install   # install.command / install.bat
    python -m scripts.data_folder             # start.command / start.bat

The last line on stdout is the folder, so a start script can capture it into ``GS1_DATA_DIR``;
everything meant for a person goes to stderr. Without ``--install`` nothing is written: an
already-set ``GS1_DATA_DIR`` wins (IT may pin one), then the same rules as the installer, read-only
— and where the installer would *create* a folder, it exits 1 asking for the installer instead.

Exempt from the ``enter_data_dir`` / ``load_env`` rule (``tests/lib/test_env.py``): it is what
*decides* the data folder, so it cannot start inside one, and it touches no credential.
