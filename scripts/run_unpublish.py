"""Take a published product back down: retract its Digital Link, draft its pages.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.run_unpublish CLIENT_ID --gtin GTIN [--gtin GTIN ...] [--dry-run]

The inverse of ``run_execute`` for a product that should no longer be public. Per GTIN,
in this order:

1. **Retract the GS1 resolver record** — ``retract`` disables the record via
   ``activationStatus`` and deliberately leaves its ``links`` in place.
2. **Draft every language's WordPress page** — guarded by ``meta.gtin``, so a stale page
   id in state cannot draft somebody else's content.
3. **Record it in state** — ``wp_status``/``gs1_enabled``, so the next run knows the
   product is down on purpose.

**The order is the point.** A drafted page is not publicly reachable, so drafting first
would leave an enabled Digital Link resolving to a 404 for as long as the window lasts —
every scanned QR in that window hitting a dead end. Retracting first degrades to "QR does
nothing", which is the intended end state anyway.

Not implemented as ``post_status: draft`` in ``clients.yml`` plus a re-run, which is the
obvious move and does not work: ``run_execute`` verifies each page with an
*unauthenticated* HEAD, a draft answers 404, the row raises, and the GTIN is blocked —
leaving the pages drafted, state unwritten and the resolver still enabled. That is the
half-done state this script exists to avoid.

Idempotent: a GTIN already retracted and drafted is a no-op. Deliberately takes explicit
``--gtin`` values rather than a plan — unpublishing is a decision about named products,
and there is no plan artifact that means "take these down".

``--dry-run`` logs the intended mutations and touches nothing.

Exit codes:
    0  every GTIN was taken down (or already was)
    1  one or more GTINs errored (state still saved for those that succeeded)
    2  config/setup error (bad client id, missing GS1 creds, unknown GTIN)
