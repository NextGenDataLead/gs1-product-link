"""Render the per-step issue reports into one human-readable data-quality worklist.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.report_quality [CLIENT_ID] [--out PATH]

``CLIENT_ID`` may be omitted when ``clients.yml`` defines exactly one client.

Reads the machine-readable issue files under ``output/{client_id}/data/``
(``source_issues.json``, ``generated_issues.json``, ``video_map_issues.json``,
``category_issues.json``) plus ``products.json`` (for product names), and writes a single
markdown report grouped by owner and action (what blocks publishing, what to review, what the
client fixes in MyGS1). Absent issue files are treated as empty (that producer has not run); a
missing data directory is a config error.

The rendering itself lives in :func:`lib.quality_report.render_quality_report` (pure); this script
is the I/O + clock wrapper (it stamps the snapshot date and each source's last-modified date).

Emits:  output/{client_id}/data-quality-report.md
Exit codes:
    0  report written
    2  config error (the client's output/{client_id}/data directory does not exist)
