# /gs1-links — Digital Links only

This is [`flow-orchestrator`](../flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md) with the mode pinned to **`links`**.

**Load `.claude/skills/flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md` and follow every step in it**, with two things
already settled by the command:

- The **mode is `links`** — build one Digital Link record per GTIN pointing at pages that already
  exist, and render the QR. No page is created, updated, or linked as a translation. State it at
  gate 0 as fixed by the command rather than derived from the phrasing; the operator still confirms
  the gate.
- Step 9 appends **`--only links`**.

Everything else — the export cross-check, the copy review, the plan gate, the production
environment confirmation, the post-run summary — happens exactly as written there. Nothing about
the gates is restated here on purpose: one copy, one place to change.

## The risk this mode carries, and what handles it

The targets do not come from a page this run just created and verified. `run_execute` resolves each
one from `state.json`, else a slug lookup on the site, else the plan row's `target_url` (built from
`wordpress.target_url_pattern`) — and **HEADs every one of them before writing anything**. A GTIN
with any target that does not serve gets no GS1 write at all.

That check is in the script, not in this file, precisely because instructions can be skipped and a
GS1 record can never be deleted: a permanent QR aimed at a 404 is not recoverable.

So when step 11 reports `refusing to point a permanent GS1 record at it`, do not work around it.
The page is not where the plan says it is — the slug may not match `slug_pattern`, or the page may
be drafted or gone. Fix `wordpress.target_url_pattern` or publish the page, then re-run. The rest of
the batch already went through.

**A dry run cannot verify.** It builds no clients, so it lists the targets it would use and says the
real run checks them. Do not read a clean dry run as proof the targets serve.

Reversible alternative: `/gs1-pages` writes the pages and stops. `/gs1-publish` does both legs.
