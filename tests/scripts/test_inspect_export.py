"""Tests for scripts/inspect_export.py (IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §8.5).

The fixture carries **both** 3297 and 3318 on one sheet, because that is the pairing the
script exists to get right and previously got wrong. 3297 is labelled *"Short product
name"* and holds an internal logistics string; 3318 is labelled *"Trade item description"*
and holds the marketing name the page titles. Suggesting the former as ``product_name`` is
the bug fixed in c76492b, which this script then went on re-proposing.
