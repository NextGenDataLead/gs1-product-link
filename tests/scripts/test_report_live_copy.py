"""Tests for scripts/report_live_copy.py — which products the Content screen offers to write for.

The site read itself is not exercised (it needs credentials); ``_fetch`` is replaced with an empty
site, which is the state of every product that has never published. What is under test is the one
decision this script makes before classifying: which in-scope products the plan will hold.
