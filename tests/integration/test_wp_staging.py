"""Live staging-WordPress smoke tests for the DoD (IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §12 Phase 4).

These are the staging-gated Definition-of-Done checks that cannot run against a mock:
§6.1 (upsert idempotency), §6.2 (media idempotency), plugin detection, and the exit gate
"published page returns 200 at its URL". They are marked ``staging`` and skipped unless
the staging environment is configured, so CI stays green on mocks.

**These write to a live WordPress site.** Everything they create is cleaned up: pages are
force-deleted and media attachments removed in a ``finally``, so a failed assertion still
tears down. Three of the four tests create *drafts*; ``test_published_page_resolves``
cannot, because an unauthenticated HEAD of a draft is a 404 and publishing is the very
thing it asserts — so it publishes, and force-deletes in its own ``finally``.

``STAGING_GTIN`` has **no default** and must be a GTIN dedicated to smoke testing — not a
saleable product. Two guards enforce it, and neither is sufficient alone: the GTIN must
sit in Noviplast's company prefix, *and* a pre-flight refuses to run if a page already
exists for it that this suite did not create. Without the second, a real product's GTIN
would let the upsert adopt its live page, overwrite it, and let teardown delete it — with
every ownership guard passing, because the GTIN would genuinely match.

Nothing auto-loads ``.env``, so export the variables (``set -a; source .env; set +a``)
before running. **Single-quote ``NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS``**: WordPress app passwords
contain spaces, so an unquoted value breaks ``source`` at the first space and loads
*empty* — every call then 401s, looking like a permissions problem::

    WP_STAGING_URL=https://staging.noviplast.nl \\
    WP_STAGING_USER=automation-bot \\
    NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS='xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx' \\

Optional overrides: ``WP_STAGING_POST_TYPE`` (default ``noviplast``),
``WP_STAGING_APP_PASS_ENV`` (default ``NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS``), ``STAGING_GTIN_PREFIX``
(default ``8713195``).
