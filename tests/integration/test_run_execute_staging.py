"""Live end-to-end run_execute DoD check (IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §12 Phase 6, §6.5).

This is the executable form of the Phase 6 exit gate — "``run_execute.py`` completes for
one GTIN end-to-end against staging" — plus the live §6.5 idempotency contract. It drives
``scripts.run_execute.main`` against a **real WordPress** site and the **GS1 production**
environment (the GS1 sandbox account has no Digital Link contract, so production is the
only environment that resolves — a project decision). It is marked ``staging`` and skipped
unless both targets are configured, so CI stays green on mocks.

**Read this before running it.**

The WordPress page **is published, not drafted** — ``verify_url`` issues an
*unauthenticated* HEAD, which a draft answers with 404, so the run would fail rather than
be made safe by drafting. The page is therefore live between its creation and the
force-delete in the teardown, and is cleaned up whatever the test did or failed at.

**The GS1 production entry cannot be deleted.** The v2 API has no DELETE for a Digital
Link. Teardown retracts it — clears its links, then disables it — which is the most that
can be done, and leaves a dead, linkless, disabled record on Noviplast's account
**forever**. That is a property of the GS1 API, not of this code.

For that reason ``STAGING_GTIN`` has **no default** and must be a GTIN dedicated to smoke
testing and nothing else. Two guards enforce it, and neither suffices alone: the GTIN must
sit in Noviplast's company prefix, *and* a pre-flight refuses to run if a page already
exists for it that this test did not create. Without the second, a real product's GTIN
would let the upsert adopt its live page, overwrite it with the smoke content, and let
teardown delete it — with every ownership guard passing, because the GTIN would genuinely
match.

Nothing auto-loads ``.env``, so export the variables (``set -a; source .env; set +a``)
before running. **Single-quote ``NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS``**: WordPress app passwords
contain spaces, so an unquoted value breaks ``source`` at the first space and loads
*empty* — the run then fails with blank credentials rather than a clear error. The secrets
reuse the canonical names from ``.env.example``; the rest is non-secret runner config::

    WP_STAGING_URL=https://staging.noviplast.nl \\
    WP_STAGING_USER=automation-bot \\
    NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS='xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx' \\
    GS1_PROD_ACCOUNT=87207XXXXXXXX \\
    NOVIPLAST_GS1_CLIENT_ID='...' NOVIPLAST_GS1_CLIENT_SECRET='...' \\
    STAGING_GTIN=08713195XXXXXX \\
    pytest -m staging

Optional overrides: ``WP_STAGING_POST_TYPE`` (default ``noviplast``),
``WP_STAGING_APP_PASS_ENV`` (default ``NOVIPLAST_WP_APP_PASS``), ``STAGING_GTIN_PREFIX``
(default ``8713195``), ``GS1_PROD_CLIENT_ID_ENV`` / ``GS1_PROD_CLIENT_SECRET_ENV`` (the
env-var *names* holding the GS1 production secrets, not the secrets themselves; default
``NOVIPLAST_GS1_CLIENT_ID`` / ``NOVIPLAST_GS1_CLIENT_SECRET``).
