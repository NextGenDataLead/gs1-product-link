"""Tests for how this repository installs itself on the operator's machine.

The operator does not run ``pip``. They double-click ``install.command`` (or ``install.bat``),
which fetches ``uv``, has it fetch a CPython, and builds ``.venv`` **from the committed
``uv.lock``** rather than from a fresh resolution. That makes the lockfile part of the product:
it is what says which versions that machine gets, and it is what an IT reviewer vets.

Two kinds of drift would break it quietly, so both are checked here:

* **``uv.lock`` against ``pyproject.toml``.** A dependency added without re-locking installs on
  the maintainer's machine (``pip install -e``) and *fails* on the operator's, where ``uv sync
  --locked`` refuses to resolve. CI also runs ``uv lock --check``, which is the authority; this
  test is the offline half, so the mismatch is visible without a network or a uv binary.
* **The pins inside the four entry points.** The uv version and the Python version are spelled
  out in the scripts and in ``.github/workflows/ci.yml``, deliberately — there is no
  ``.python-version`` file, because pyenv reads that too and would break ``python`` in this
  directory for anyone who has pyenv without 3.11. Spelling a constant four times only works if
  something notices when one copy moves.
