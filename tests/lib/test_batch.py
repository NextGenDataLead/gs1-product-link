"""What batch is in force, and whether the two files belong together.

The property under most of this is that **three answers are not two**: the ticks were chosen against
this export, against an earlier one, or nobody recorded it. Every batch saved before the ledger
existed is in the third state, so collapsing it into either of the other two would make the common
case the wrong answer.
