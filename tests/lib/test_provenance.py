"""The ledger: what a derived artefact records about where it came from.

Two properties carry the weight here, and both are about failing safely rather than about the happy
path. A record that could not be written must never fail the operator's save. And a record that is
*absent* must read as "not recorded", never as "there is no source" — those are different answers
and only one of them is safe to show somebody deciding whether to publish.
