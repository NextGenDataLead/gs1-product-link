"""Tests for lib/live_inventory.py — everything this tool has put live, from the ledger.

Operator, 2026-10-07: a data-quality report for every product that went live, to give it follow-up.
The ledger records each page this machine wrote; a retracted or unpublished page is not live. The
site is the authority on what is there now, so the inventory says per page whether the site was
checked and what it answered — and never claims "live" for a page the check could not see.
