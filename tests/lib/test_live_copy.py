"""Tests for lib/live_copy.py — bucketing products against what the site actually carries.

The module exists because ``state.json`` cannot answer this question on a machine that did not do
the publishing, and the whole point is to be right about a page nobody here wrote. So the cases
worth covering are the ones where the site disagrees with what a ledger would have said: a page
that is live in one language and absent in the other, a page that exists with its generated fields
blank (the silent ACF failure this pipeline has already produced), and a product nothing on this
machine can ever write copy for.
