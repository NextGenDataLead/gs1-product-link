"""Tests for lib/gates.py — including the drift check that keeps it honest.

The gates are this project's safety mechanism and they are written twice: as prose a model reads
in ``.claude/skills/flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md``, and as structure a form-rendering UI reads in
``lib/gates.py``. Two implementations of one contract drift, and this one drifts *silently* — a
gate that quietly stops being shown raises nothing at all.

So the SKILL carries a **Gate index** table and these tests assert the two agree in both
directions. Adding a gate to either without the other fails CI.
