"""Tests for lib/scope_report.py — the operator's list with what the run did to each row.

The report joins two documents that do not share a vocabulary: a list of barcodes the operator
wrote, and a log keyed by ``(gtin, language)`` the tool wrote. Everything worth asserting here is
about the seams between them.

Above all: **a hold is not a failure.** ``lib.preflight.check_video_coverage`` puts the reason
best — calling a handled condition a failure is how a report earns the right to be ignored — and
this file is forwarded to the client, who will act on the word in the cell.
