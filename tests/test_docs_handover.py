"""What the operator's machine cannot get from a clone, and what the doc promises about it.

Five files are gitignored and have to be handed over separately. The install rehearsal found the
doc naming **two** of them, and the omission with permanent consequences — ``state.json`` — was one
of the three it did not mention. Without that file every already-published GTIN classifies as NEW:
a second page each, and another GS1 record each, which can never be deleted.

That is not a defect a reader notices, because a doc that lists two files reads exactly as
confidently as one that lists five. So the list is asserted here instead, against the names the code
and the shipped example config actually use — a rename on either side fails this test rather than
silently making the doc wrong.

This checks that each file is *named and explained*. It cannot check that the explanation is any
good; that is what review is for.
