"""The shell may *offer* generation; it may never *do* it.

``ui/__init__.py`` used to claim the shell had no LLM at all, and that claim was enforced by
nothing — unlike the ``.env`` half of the same paragraph, which ``tests/lib/test_env.py`` walks
the AST for. The claim held only because nobody had written the import.

Now that the Content screen has a Generate button, the property that matters is narrower and has
to be real: reaching Anthropic stays the **subprocess's** job. ``ui/`` builds an argv and streams
the output; ``scripts/run_generate.py`` loads ``.env`` in its own ``__main__`` block, holds the
key, and makes the call. Nothing in this long-lived desktop process ever holds the credential or
opens the socket.

The two halves are separable and this is the one without a guard, so it gets one. An in-process
``AnthropicClient`` would work first time, look identical on screen, and quietly undo the reason
the subprocess seam exists.

AST rather than a text scan, for the reason ``tests/lib/test_env.py`` gives: a text scan forbids
*mentioning* the rule, so neither this file nor the docstring explaining it could be written.
