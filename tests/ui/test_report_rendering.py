"""The §0 header marks, against the markdown renderer the Data screen actually uses.

This report is read on **two** surfaces, and the mandatory/optional distinction has now been got
wrong once on each. `**product·3301**` was invisible when rendered, because markdown makes header
cells bold anyway. The `MANDATORY<br>…` group label that replaced it rendered correctly and put a
literal HTML tag in front of everyone reading the markdown as text.

So the mark has to be plain text that survives rendering — which is not free: `~` is
markdown-adjacent (`~~x~~` is strikethrough in several flavours), and a renderer that grew that
extra would silently eat it. That is what these tests pin, on `ui/pages/data.py`'s actual path:
``ui.markdown`` → markdown2 with ``['fenced-code-blocks', 'tables']``.

Lives under ``tests/ui/`` because markdown2 arrives with NiceGUI: in the required CI job, which
installs only ``.[dev]``, there is nothing here to import.
