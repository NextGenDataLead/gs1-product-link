"""The selection model on the Data screen: what a filter does to a tick, and what it must not.

The screen follows the spreadsheet rule people actually expect: **a tick belongs to a row, not to
the view.** Filtering changes what is on screen and nothing else; a bulk tick or untick acts on the
rows the filters are showing; the running total counts the whole file. The two cases the operator
described are the two tests below — filter then untick, and untick-all then filter then tick.

Why this is held in Python rather than read off the table: a Quasar table's ``selected`` only ever
holds rows it is currently rendering, so a ticked row that a filter hides drops out of it. Saving
from that list loses rows the operator never touched, and nothing on screen disagrees — the count
would be consistent with itself the whole way down.
