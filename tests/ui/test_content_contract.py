"""The contract between the Content screen and the scope it is supposed to respect.

The screen showed a *scoped* coverage figure directly above an *unscoped* list of copy, with
nothing to tell them apart. The figures came from the doctor; the list read
``generation_results.json`` off disk and rendered every GTIN in it. That file is written per run
now, but a results file produced against a longer process list carries the same trap.

AST-only, so this needs no NiceGUI and runs in the required CI job rather than the optional one.
