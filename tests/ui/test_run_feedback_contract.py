"""A button must show that it is working, and it must not freeze the page while it does.

Both halves of one incident. Publishing twenty rows from the shell produced **two identical
complete runs**: ``run_execute`` prints one line when it starts and one when it finishes, so the
console sat silent for about ninety seconds, nothing disabled the button, and the operator
reasonably concluded it had not worked and clicked again. Twenty live pages were rewritten twice.
The same second click in ``links`` or ``both`` mode is aimed at records that can never be deleted.

The fix is in two places because the defect was:

* ``ui/theme.py`` disables the button and shows a spinner and the elapsed seconds — there rather
  than at the two dozen call sites, so a screen written later inherits it without an edit;
* the screens run their subprocess **off the event loop**, because a blocking ``subprocess.run``
  in a click handler holds the loop until the command has already finished. Every UI change queued
  before it — including the one saying the command is running — then reaches the browser with
  nothing left to report, and the screen looks identical from click to result.

Neither half works alone, which is why both are checked here. AST-only, so this needs no NiceGUI
and runs in the required CI job rather than the optional one.
