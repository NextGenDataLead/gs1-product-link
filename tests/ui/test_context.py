"""Tests for ui/context.py — reading the doctor's answer rather than re-deriving it.

Gate 0 used to lead with the length of ``products.json`` under the label "products in the
catalogue". Honest, and the wrong number: it read **127** on a run scoped to one product, at the
gate where the operator forms their picture of what they are about to do.

The fix is not to compute scope in the shell. ``lib.preflight.in_scope`` already composes the two
gates that decide it, and a second implementation of "what will this run touch" is the same class
of mistake as a second implementation of the operator gates. So the shell reads the doctor's
``scope`` check, and these tests cover the reading — including every way it can be unreadable,
because the one thing that must never happen is a catalogue total shown under a scope label.

No NiceGUI: ``ui.context`` imports only ``lib`` and ``ui.REPO_ROOT``, so this runs in the required
CI job rather than the optional one.
