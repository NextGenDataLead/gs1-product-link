"""Tests for ui/content_session.py — Content keeps its live-site check for the session.

Operator: going back to Content hid steps 2 and 3 again; that should happen at a new session,
not when moving back and forth. The check is kept per client and per batch: a check of the
batch saved before a change on Data says nothing about the batch saved after it.
