"""The screens, against the NiceGUI they will actually run on.

Every other test under ``tests/ui/`` either parses source with :mod:`ast` or imports one of the
NiceGUI-free modules (``ui.session``, ``ui.config_edit``, ``ui.runner`` …). That is deliberate —
it is what lets them run in the required CI job, which installs ``.[dev]`` to prove ``lib`` never
grows a UI dependency. The cost was that **no test imported a screen at all**, so ``ui/pages/``
was the one surface CI never touched, and an unbounded ``nicegui>=2.0`` broke two screens without
anything going red (#52, and the pattern behind #53 and #54).

This module is the other side of that split. It skips wholesale where NiceGUI is absent and runs
in the ``Operator shell (ui extra)`` job, where it asserts the two things an AST check cannot:
that every screen still *imports* against the installed NiceGUI, and that the routes and the left
rail still agree about which screens exist.

It is not a rendering test. It cannot tell you a screen looks right — only that a version bump
has not made one unreachable or unimportable, which is the failure that actually happened.
