"""Tests for ui/process_list_edit.py — installing, pruning and restoring the control file.

The operator's recurring job, and the one step where the shell writes to a file they authored.
The properties worth asserting are the ones that make that safe: other columns survive, the
previous version survives, the file they *uploaded* survives every save after it — the per-run
result sheet reads it to name the rows they dropped — and an empty result is refused.
