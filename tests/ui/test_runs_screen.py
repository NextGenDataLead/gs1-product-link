"""The Runs screen's error line (issue #60).

The screen renders one line per failed row, and that line was the operator's whole view of a
failure: ``08713195007717 (fr): WordPressAPIError('WordPress API error 403')``. It did not say
which of the row's five HTTP calls had failed, so answering that meant leaving the shell and
re-running with the output piped to a file.

Needs NiceGUI, because ``ui.pages.runs`` imports it — so this runs in the second CI job, not the
required one. See ``tests/ui/test_pages_contract.py`` for why the suite is split that way.
