"""The contract between the shell's upload handlers and NiceGUI's upload event.

This exists because of a real failure, found on the first from-scratch operator install. NiceGUI 2
handed the handler ``event.content``, a file-like object read synchronously. NiceGUI 3 replaced it
with ``event.file``, whose read methods are awaitable. ``pyproject.toml`` said ``nicegui>=2.0``, so
a fresh install resolved 3.x against code written for 2.x — and **both** uploads in the shell broke
at once: the export on the Data screen and the copy cache on the Content screen.

What made it serious was the shape of the failure, not the cause. The handler raised inside
NiceGUI, which logged it to the terminal; the browser showed the file at 100% with a checkmark and
no error; and nothing was written. An operator would have seen a successful upload and a parse that
insisted the file did not exist. Publishing nothing while reporting success is the outcome this
project refuses everywhere else — :mod:`ui.session` raises rather than build a command past an
unanswered gate, and an empty plan is refused rather than run — so it should not have been reachable
here either.

Two checks, deliberately split by what they need:

* :func:`test_every_upload_handler_is_async` and
  :func:`test_no_upload_handler_reads_the_removed_2x_attribute` are **AST** checks. They need no
  NiceGUI, so they run in the required CI job, which installs only ``.[dev]``.
* :func:`test_the_installed_nicegui_still_offers_the_api_the_handlers_use` checks the other side of
  the contract against the real package, and skips where it is absent. It runs in the
  ``Operator shell (ui extra)`` job — added in #59, because until then nothing in CI ever ran it,
  and this is the check that would have caught the break above.
