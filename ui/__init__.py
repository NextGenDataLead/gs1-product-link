"""The local operator shell: a desktop window over the same CLIs a person would type.

Run it with ``python -m ui`` after ``pip install -e ".[ui]"``.

Three design decisions shape everything here, and each is load-bearing.

**The UI subprocesses the scripts; it never imports their ``main()``.** ``load_env()`` lives in
each script's ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` block by design — nine test modules call ``main()``
directly, and ``.env`` carries the four staging-guard variables, so loading it in the test path
would arm tests that write to live WordPress and the GS1 production resolver. A shell that
imported ``main()`` would therefore have **no credentials**; one that called ``load_env()`` itself
would re-arm that hazard inside a long-lived process. Subprocessing sidesteps both, and inherits
the production guard, the ``state.json`` writes, the run JSONL and the ``--only links``
target-serves refusal unchanged — all of which live in ``scripts/``, not ``lib/``.

It also means the UI runs exactly the command a human would, so ``docs/verifying-live.md``, the
skills and the terminal all stay valid as a fallback when something here is wrong.

**Whether this machine reaches Anthropic is decided by one variable, and the default is no.**
With the client's ``generator.api_key_env`` unset, the shell holds no LLM credential and has no
Anthropic egress at all: copy is written on the maintainer's machine in a Claude Code session with
the ``content-generator`` skill, and ``generation_results.json`` is uploaded here as a file. Set
that variable and the Content screen offers generation itself, so the shell becomes one access
point from dataset to pages instead of a surface with a hole in the middle.

**The key never enters this process either way.** Generating runs the same subprocess as every
other step, and the child loads ``.env`` in its own ``__main__`` block — which is the first
decision above, not an exception to it. ``tests/ui/test_llm_free_shell.py`` walks the AST of this
package to keep the API call out of here. See ``docs/ui-operator-shell.md``.

**The gates come from** :mod:`lib.gates`, **not from this package.** They are the safety
mechanism, they are also written as prose in ``flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md``, and two
implementations of one safety contract drift silently. A test asserts the two agree.
