"""Write the process list: install an uploaded one, prune it, and put the upload back.

The control file is a list of GTINs and nothing more: being on it is the whole meaning, the tool
reads no cell values, and the operator prepares a batch by **choosing which rows run**. That is
the one step of the loop where a mis-click is expensive in the ordinary way — the wrong rows
publish, or the right rows do not.

So this module keeps these properties:

* **Every other column is preserved verbatim.** Only the GTIN column is configured; the rest are
  the operator's working notes, and a tool that dropped them would be taking away the reason they
  keep the file.
* **Every upload is kept, dated.** ``uploads/product-list-{stamp}.xlsx`` is written the moment a
  file arrives, before anything is derived from it. Dating them on the way *in* rather than on the
  way out is the difference between "every original you ever sent" and "the one before the current
  one": archiving on replacement means a file uploaded once and never replaced has no dated copy
  at all.
* **The current upload has a stable name.** ``uploads/product-list.xlsx`` is the newest upload
  under a name that does not move, because three things need to find it without guessing — the
  Restore control on the Data screen, the run that copies it into its own directory, and
  ``scripts/report_scope_result.py``, which reads that copy to name the rows the operator
  deselected. Resolving it by "newest file in the folder" would make any stray copy dropped into
  the directory silently become the operator's original.
* **Every save is kept, dated.** ``selection/selection-{stamp}.xlsx`` is written *as the save
  happens*, holding what was chosen — the same rule as uploads, for the same reason. Archiving
  the file being **replaced** instead produced two wrong records: the first save filed the
  untouched upload as though it were a chosen selection, and the selection actually in force had
  no dated copy at all until a later save displaced it. Both are visible by counting — one list
  appeared twice under two meanings, and the current one appeared once.
* **``uploads/`` and ``selection/`` are kept apart.** An upload is the operator's own document;
  a selection is what they chose from it. Mixing them loses which is which exactly when somebody
  is looking for the original.
* **Neither archive decides what gets written.** A design that derived the control file from the
  upload would put a wrong join between the operator and their own list, silently.
* **An empty result is refused.** ``load_process_list`` already treats zero GTINs as an error
  rather than an empty run, for the reason this project keeps designing against: an empty plan
  and a successful-looking no-op are indistinguishable. Saving an empty file here would just move
  that failure one step earlier.

**None of those paths are spelled here.** They live in :mod:`lib.input_layout`, which is the one
module that knows the shape of ``input/`` — because ``scripts/`` needs the same answers and cannot
import ``ui/``. This module is re-exporting them so its own callers and tests keep working.

Reading is :func:`lib.process_list.read_process_list` — the same call a run makes, not a second
opinion about the same file. Writing is openpyxl. No NiceGUI, so it is testable without a browser.
