"""Routing and startup for the operator shell.

Bound to ``127.0.0.1`` and opened in a native window rather than a browser tab. The window is not
cosmetic: this process reaches a live WordPress site and the GS1 production resolver, and a
listening socket on a workstation is a thing IT will ask about. One that answers only to loopback
and has no visible URL to share is a much shorter conversation.

``reload=False`` because the reloader re-executes the module, and a shell that restarts itself
mid-run would orphan a subprocess that is writing permanent records.
