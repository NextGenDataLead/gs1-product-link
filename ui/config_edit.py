"""Edit named scalars in ``clients.yml`` without disturbing anything else in it.

``clients.yml`` is not a serialised data structure — it is a document. Most of its lines are
comments, and several of them are the only written record of why a value is what it is: why the
pilot's ``environment`` overrides the ``test`` default, why ``account_number_production`` was
corrected after a 200 proved nothing, why the ``generator`` block must stay even on a machine with
no API key. Round-tripping through ``yaml.safe_load``/``safe_dump`` would delete every one of them,
and a round-trip YAML library would still collapse the hand-alignment of the ``gdsn_map`` rows.

So this module edits the **text**. It locates a key by walking indentation, rewrites the value on
that one line — keeping the key, the indent, and any trailing comment — and leaves every other byte
alone. A key that does not exist yet is inserted into its block rather than merged from above.

Three rules make that safe enough to put behind a form:

* **Only the client's own block is ever written.** Every path starts ``clients.{client_id}``, so a
  form can never edit the shared ``defaults`` block and change another client's behaviour. A value
  inherited from ``defaults`` and then edited becomes a per-client override, which is what the
  operator meant.
* **Unchanged fields are not written at all.** The caller passes only what differs, so saving an
  untouched form produces no diff and an inherited default stays inherited.
* **The result is validated before it replaces the file.** :func:`write_validated` writes a
  candidate beside the original, runs :func:`lib.preflight.check_config` over it — the same check
  the doctor runs, reporting *every* offending field rather than the first — and only then swaps it
  in, keeping the previous version as ``clients.yml.bak``.

No NiceGUI here, so the whole thing is testable without a browser.
