"""Report which credentials ``.env`` holds, and set new ones — without ever reading one back.

``clients.yml`` names the environment variables; ``.env`` holds their values. That split is the
whole credential design (OD-1), and this module is the only place in the shell that touches the
second half of it.

**It does not load ``.env``.** Not with ``lib.env``, not with ``python-dotenv``, not by any other
route — ``tests/lib/test_env.py`` walks the AST of every module under ``ui/`` and fails the build
if one does. The reason is not tidiness: loading it would put a production WordPress application
password and GS1 production OAuth credentials into a long-lived desktop process, and would arm the
four staging-guard variables inside it. The subprocesses load it themselves, in their own
``__main__`` blocks, which is why the shell can stay ignorant. ``ENV_PATH`` is therefore spelled
out here rather than imported from ``lib.env``, whose import alone would trip that check.

**Every field over this module is write-only.** :func:`describe` answers *whether* a name has a
value and how many whitespace-separated groups it has — never the value. A form that showed a
secret back would put it in a screenshot, a support ticket and a shoulder-surf, and would buy
nothing: an operator who wants to know the password is correct should press Test, which asks
WordPress.

The group count is not trivia. A WordPress application password is issued as six space-separated
groups, and the single commonest credential failure in this project is a value that lost its
quotes in ``.env`` and was truncated at the first — producing a 401 with a password the operator
is certain is right. So values written here are always quoted, and a short one is reported as
short before anything is run.
