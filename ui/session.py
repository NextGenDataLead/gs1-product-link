"""One publish run's gate answers, and the refusal to build a command without them.

This is the part of the shell that matters. Everything else here is a nicer way to look at files;
this is the safety contract, and it is enforced **in code** rather than in prose — which is the
one thing the existing skill-based flow cannot do. `CLAUDE.md` is blunt about the cost of prose:
the operator gates live only in a Markdown file, and calling `run_execute` directly bypasses every
one of them. A required checkbox that a function refuses to proceed without is a stronger gate
than a paragraph a model might paraphrase, compress, or skip when the context is long.

The rule is one sentence: :meth:`PublishSession.execute_argv` raises unless every *required*
applicable gate has been answered with an option that proceeds. Not "warns". Not "logs". A shell
that could be talked into building the command anyway would be prose again, wearing a form.

Gate applicability, ordering and the argv itself all come from :mod:`lib.gates`, which
``flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md`` is checked against. Nothing here decides which gates exist.
