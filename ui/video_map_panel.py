"""The client's video mapping file, as the Data screen's sign-off import reads and writes it.

**The mapping is edited in the file, not in the shell.** ``videos/mapping.yml`` is the client's
sign-off; the operator adjusts it there. The row-by-row editor and its figures that used to sit on
the Data screen, folded under *The mapping, file by file*, were removed on the operator's word
(2026-10-06): what a batch needs to know about videos is already in step 4's *Missing video(s)*
and the data-quality report, and a second editor of one sign-off file invites edits nobody signed.

What is left is the one write the shell still makes to it — filling unset rows from the client's
sign-off sheet (:mod:`ui.video_signoff_panel`) — and the session that write goes through:

**Every write re-reads the file**, so nothing on screen asks to be reloaded, and a file changed on
disk since it was read — edited by hand, which is now the normal way — is re-read before the import
is re-planned, rather than silently overwritten. ``video_map_edit.write_validated`` refusing a
candidate that lost a row stays the backstop.
