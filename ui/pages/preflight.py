"""Screen 4 — the preflight, as a list to work down.

Runs ``python -m scripts.doctor --json`` in a subprocess and renders what it says. The checks are
not reimplemented here; a second implementation would be a second thing to keep true.

Subprocessing is what makes the credential checks work at all: ``load_env()`` runs in the
script's ``__main__`` block, so this process holds no secrets and the child resolves them itself.

**The whole preflight runs by itself on arrival, with no buttons** (operator, 2026-10-07: "run
both automatically and present a loading animation … This also eliminates the need for buttons").
It used to run only the offline half on arrival and keep the credentials half behind a button,
on the argument that landing on a screen should not log in anywhere. With the steps opening only
through Next (:mod:`ui.progress`), arriving here *is* the deliberate act — and the offline result
on screen read as an old one, waiting to be replaced. Every check is read-only. Each visit runs it
afresh; nothing from an earlier run is shown.
