"""Screen 1 — what this machine is configured to do, to whom, and with which credentials.

The two most expensive mistakes in this pipeline are both *config* mistakes that nothing
downstream notices: pointing at the wrong export, and pointing at production. Until this screen
existed, both were made in a text editor, in a file whose rules are not visible from inside it,
and discovered at the first API call — or, in the worst case, after a permanent record was written.

Four things about the form are deliberate.

**It writes only what changed.** The values shown are the *resolved* config, ``defaults`` merged
in. Writing them all back would freeze every inherited default into this client's block. See
:mod:`ui.form`.

**The client id is not editable.** It is the path to ``output/{client_id}/state.json``, which
records every GTIN already published. Renaming it does not move that file — it orphans it, and
every published GTIN would classify as new on the next run against a live site.

**Switching to production asks for the client id, typed in full.** That flag decides whether a run
writes permanent, undeletable records. It is the same decision the production gate asks about, and
it was previously one word in a text file changed with no confirmation at all.

**Credentials are write-only.** The fields set values in ``.env`` and never show one back; whether
a name resolves is answered by the Test buttons, which ask WordPress and GS1 rather than reading
the file. See :mod:`ui.env_edit`. There is **no Anthropic key field** — this machine has no LLM.

``gdsn_map``, ``acf_map``, ``brick_category_map`` and ``generator`` stay read-only: the first three
were each settled by a field walk against the live site, and ``generator`` is the E21 switch rather
than a preference.
