"""Screen 3 — the generated copy: written here when there is a key, imported when there is not.

Copy has two producers and one results file. A Claude Code session running the
``content-generator`` skill writes it on the maintainer's machine and hands over
``generation_results.json``; the Anthropic Messages API writes the same file headlessly. This
screen offers whichever is available, then says how much of the current export the file covers and
shows the text per language.

**Which one is offered is decided by the key, not by a setting.** With the client's
``generator.api_key_env`` unset, this machine holds no credential and reaches Anthropic not at
all — the documented arrangement, and still the default. Setting it turns generation on here, so
the shell becomes one access point from dataset to pages rather than a surface with a hole in the
middle of it. Either way the key stays out of this process: generating runs
``scripts.run_generate`` as a subprocess, which loads ``.env`` in its own ``__main__`` block.

**Coverage is the load-bearing part.** Copy is written fresh for each run and never stored, so the
question is not how much has piled up but whether *this* file answers every unit the run will
publish — and whether it still describes this export. Not every in-scope unit: copy is written for
the rows a run creates or changes, so an already-live unchanged unit needs none, and neither does
a product the plan will hold for a missing video or missing mandatory data. Both are excluded from
the count rather than reported as a shortfall, and the check's detail line names each separately —
one of them is finished and the other is waiting on the client. Its fingerprint covers
``{inputs, language, prompt_version}``, so editing one product in the feed, or bumping the prompt
version, leaves that unit uncovered. An uncovered unit with no producer on this machine is an E21
omission: it leaves the plan without a row. Before ``Plan.skipped`` existed it left without a trace
at all, and an empty plan looked exactly like a plan with nothing to do.

So the count is shown before the copy is, and a shortfall is stated as a shortfall.

    **Each step opens when the one before it succeeds** (operator feedback, 2026-10-07): step 2
    once the site has been read, step 3 — and Next, through ``unlock`` — once every product the
    site says needs text has it in every language, written now or by an earlier Generate.

    Everything here used to be derived from ``state.json``: which units a run would write, which
    of those had copy, how much was outstanding. That ledger records what *this machine* wrote and
    does not travel between machines, so on a second operator's copy it can be confidently wrong
    about a page that is live and correct. The one question this screen exists to answer — *does
    this product have a tagline and an Eigenschappen block?* — has an authoritative source, and it
    is the site.

    **Three numbered steps, in the order they are done** (operator feedback, 2026-10-07): check the
    live site, generate the content, review it. One button asks the site, and three numbers come
    back, each labelled with what happens to it: **generate** (no live text and the export can
    supply it), **skip** (no live text and it cannot — a MyGS1 worklist, not a button), and **skip**
    (live text already).

    The third is skipped *by default*, and that is the only part a person has to decide: whether
    the inputs moved since the live text was written. Nothing here can tell — the site reports
    that a tagline exists, never which export values produced it, and the fingerprint that would
    say is in the ledger this screen exists to stop depending on. So it is a tick box, and the
    ticks join the automatic set in **one** Generate button: two buttons made the run two runs, and
    an operator who pressed only the obvious one wrote half of what they meant to.

    The read is slow (a listing per language, then one request per page, because a language-scoped
    read answers ``acf: []`` on this site) and needs credentials this process does not hold. So it
    is a subprocess, and it runs only when pressed.
