"""Screen 5 — the gated publish. The screen this whole shell exists for.

Every gate in ``lib.gates`` is rendered here as a form, in step order, and
:class:`ui.session.PublishSession` refuses to build a command while a required one is outstanding.
That refusal is the improvement over prose: a paragraph can be paraphrased, compressed or skipped
when the context is long, and a function that raises cannot.

The screen adds nothing to the contract. It renders the gates the contract declares, in the order
it declares, with the reason each exists shown alongside the question — a form that asks without
saying why teaches an operator to answer without reading, and this flow's whole cost is
concentrated in one unreviewed click.
