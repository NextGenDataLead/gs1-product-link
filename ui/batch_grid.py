"""Step 5 of the Data screen, and the coverage funnel above it: which products are in the batch.

**The selection comes first, and everything under it is about the selection** (operator,
2026-10-09). The table at the top is every row of the list, each with a **Status** — what a run
would do with it — and a tick box. Under it, one folded table per problem, holding only the
**ticked** products that have it:

* **not in the GS1 export** — on the list, nothing behind it;
* for a batch that writes pages: **not eligible** (missing data, or two videos for one language,
  from :mod:`lib.eligibility`) and **missing video(s)** (they run, without a video somewhere);
* for a links-only batch: **link doesn't work** — no page to point at, or one that does not load.

Coverage counts the same ticked products. A 117-row list with four ticked is a batch of four, and
the other 113's problems are not this batch's.

The funnel counts **products** (distinct barcodes), not spreadsheet rows: the pilot's own list
carries one barcode on two rows, and a run publishes products.

**The rows are the uploaded list; the ticks are the saved batch.** The grid is built from the list
as it arrived, every row of it, and a row is ticked when the saved selection names its barcode — so
a restart shows the whole list with the batch the later screens act on ticked, never a different
one. A new upload replaces both, so everything arrives ticked again. **Next saves the ticked rows
that can run and nothing else**: the saved file *is* the batch, and every screen after this one
counts it as such — a ticked row the run would drop is named in the caption, not written.

**A tick survives anything but a new list.** Unticked rows are remembered per client for the life
of the process, so a mapping edit that rebuilds this step — a video arriving can make a product
eligible — does not cost the operator the choices they had made.
