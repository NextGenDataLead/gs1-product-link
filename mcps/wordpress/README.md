# wordpress-mcp

MCP server wrapping the **WordPress REST API v2**. Exposes five tools
(IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §9.2):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `wp_upsert_page` | Create/update one product page idempotently (lookup by id → slug → `meta.gtin`, scoped to `language`); writes `acf` in a follow-up call |
| `wp_upload_media` | Upload a media file as `multipart/form-data`, deduped by a content-addressed slug (`{base}-{sha12}`); returns its id |
| `wp_find_by_slug` | Find a page by slug under a post type, optionally scoped to `language` (`null` if absent) |
| `wp_verify_url` | Whether a URL resolves to a 2xx/3xx via HEAD |
| `wp_detect_multilingual` | Detect the site's multilingual plugin: `polylang`, `wpml`, or `none` |

The two **write** tools — `wp_upsert_page` and `wp_upload_media` — are gated: each asks the
operator through MCP elicitation before touching the site, using the `intent` gate from
[`lib/gates.py`](../../lib/gates.py), and **refuses to write when no human can be asked**. The three
read-only tools are ungated. See [The writes are gated](#the-writes-are-gated) below.

The tools hide plumbing (`site_url`, credentials, `post_status`) and resolve it from
`clients.yml` by `client_id`. The HTTP client mirrors the authoritative Python client
(`lib/wp_client.py`): HTTP Basic auth with an application password, the retry policy
(§5.1; a `401` is terminal — no token dance), the 3-step upsert lookup with the E8
(mismatched `meta.gtin`) and E11 (non-GTIN slug collision) guards, and the media contract:
a content-addressed slug (`{base}-{sha12}`) so dedup is a pure slug lookup, multipart
uploads, and a stored-size check that refuses and deletes a truncated upload before the
call that would claim its slug (§6.1 / §6.2). Deliberate differences are listed under
[Parity with `lib/wp_client.py`](#parity-with-libwp_clientpy).

## Configuration

Resolved per call from `clients.yml`:

- **File location** — `clients.yml` in the working directory, or set `GS1_CLIENTS_FILE`.
- **Auth (Application Passwords)** — HTTP Basic with `wordpress.username` and the
  application password read from the env var named by `wordpress.app_password_env`.
  The password and the derived `Authorization` header are never logged.
- **Post type** — `wordpress.post_type` (a custom post type must be registered with
  `show_in_rest => true`); defaults per tool call when a tool omits `post_type`.
- **Multilingual** — `wordpress.multilingual_plugin` (`none` | `polylang` | `wpml`) drives
  the `lang` field on writes; `wp_detect_multilingual` probes the site to confirm.

## Develop

```bash
npm ci                          # from repo root (npm workspaces)
npm -w mcps/wordpress run build # tsc -> dist/
npm -w mcps/wordpress test      # vitest
npm -w mcps/wordpress start     # serve over stdio
```

## Survey: adopt vs. fork

PROJECT_HANDOVER §8.2 requires a time-boxed survey of the WordPress MCP ecosystem before
building. Handover risk R1 anticipated "the WordPress MCP ecosystem is too immature; build
from scratch" and §6.1 recommended **"Adopt, likely fork."** The survey (GitHub, Jul 2026)
confirms that recommendation.

| Candidate | What it is | Why not adopted here |
|---|---|---|
| [Automattic/wordpress-mcp](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-mcp) (official; basis of iOSDevSK's WooCommerce fork) | A **WordPress plugin** exposing generic "abilities" with JWT auth, running *inside* the site | Inverts the trust model (server-side plugin vs. our client-side orchestrator); no `meta.gtin`-keyed idempotency, no Polylang translation linking, no per-client `clients.yml` credential resolution |
| [stifli-flex-mcp](https://github.com/estebanstifli/stifli-flex-mcp) (129+ tools), [c-sakel/wp-mcp-server](https://github.com/c-sakel/wp-mcp-server) (190+ tools), [wp-mcp-ultimate](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/wp-mcp-ultimate) (58 abilities) | Broad generic REST-wrapper management servers | Huge generic tool surface for a 5-tool need; single-site/single-credential; none implement the §6.1/§6.2 idempotency contracts or E8/E11 semantics |
| [autowpmcp](https://github.com/Njengah/autowpmcp), [gopalcnepal/mcp-wordpress](https://github.com/gopalcnepal/mcp-wordpress) | Single-purpose blog publisher / read-only fetchers | Single-site, single-credential; no custom post type + `meta` idempotency; not multi-client |
| WooCommerce MCPs ([techspawn](https://github.com/techspawn/woocommerce-mcp-server), [iOSDevSK](https://github.com/iOSDevSK/mcp-for-woocommerce)) | WooCommerce store automation | Different product model (Woo store, not custom-post-type pages); out of scope |

**Decision: fork the in-repo `gs1-nl` pattern** — build a thin, purpose-built client that
mirrors `lib/wp_client.py`. No off-the-shelf server provides (1) per-call multi-client
credentials from `clients.yml`, (2) GTIN-keyed idempotency (`meta.gtin` upsert key + a
content-addressed media slug), (3) Polylang/WPML translation linking, or (4) the E8/E11 guards.
Standardising on the gs1-nl structure (same `ToolDeps` injection, `{ok, error}` envelope,
retry loop) keeps the two MCPs maintainable as one codebase.

## The writes are gated

`CLAUDE.md` says publishing goes through `flow-orchestrator` because "the operator gates live only
in that skill" and calling the scripts directly "bypasses every one of them". An ungated tool call
was the same bypass wearing a different hat: a model could call `wp_upsert_page` and the page was
written, with nothing between the decision and the live site.

Now `wp_upsert_page` and `wp_upload_media` ask the **operator** first, via MCP elicitation — which
puts the question to the human running the client, not to the assistant calling the tool. A prompt
the model could answer itself would be theatre.

The gate is `intent` (step 0) and **not** `production` (step 8): WordPress pages are the reversible
leg, and `lib/gates.py` skips the production gate in `pages` mode deliberately — "a second
production prompt for a page you can delete trains the operator to click through them". The
permanent writes live in [`gs1-nl`](../gs1-nl/README.md), and that server gates on both.

**It fails closed.** `elicitInput` throws when the client has not declared the `elicitation`
capability, and the tools let that refusal stand: a client that cannot reach a human cannot write.
A declined *or dismissed* prompt is a refusal — consent is never inferred.

`src/gates.generated.ts` is written by `python -m scripts.export_gates` from `lib/gates.py`.
Do not edit it: `tests/lib/test_gates_export.py` and a CI step both fail when it is stale. Gate text
in TypeScript would otherwise have become a fourth hand-maintained copy of the safety contract —
the failure mode the section below exists to record.

## Parity with `lib/wp_client.py`

This client is a **second implementation of the same contract**, so it drifts silently every
time the Python one is fixed against reality. It has happened twice. Issue #75 caught four media
fixes that had never crossed; auditing the rest of the surface immediately afterwards found
**five more**, all older, and all in code this client does implement. This section is the
countermeasure — **keep it true, or the next reader inherits the same problem.**

**Last audited: 2026-08-12**, against `lib/wp_client.py` in full. The client was scaffolded at
`3cc0274` (2026-07-12) and every Python fix after that date is a drift candidate; the audit method
is at the end of this section.

Mirrored, and load-bearing enough to name:

- **Multipart uploads.** A security plugin on the live site refused an ordinary H.264 video sent
  as a raw body with `Content-Disposition`, answering a bare HTML `403`, while accepting the
  identical bytes as `multipart/form-data` (PR #62). `RequestOptions` therefore has no raw-body
  mode at all — its absence is a guarantee, not an oversight.
- **A content-addressed media slug**, `{base}-{sha12}`. Dedup is a pure slug lookup, so it needs
  no read-back of `meta.content_sha256` — which requires REST to expose attachment meta, and the
  live site did not — and a stale attachment sharing only the base slug cannot shadow the match.
- **A stored-size check** before the finalise call, since the finalise is what claims the content
  slug. A truncated upload once returned `201` and left a 1.5 MB fragment of an 8 MB video that
  WordPress served happily (PR #72). The fragment is deleted and `MediaIntegrityError` raised.
- **An ownership predicate**: only attachments carrying a **non-empty** `meta.content_sha256` are
  ours to delete (PR #73). Non-empty rather than present, because the key is registered site-wide
  on the pilot — present on all 406 attachments, non-empty on only the 40 from this tool.
- **Language-scoped lookups.** On a multilingual site the same slug exists once per language and
  an unscoped collection query answers for the **default language only**. Both language pages
  share a `meta.gtin`, so the E8 guard cannot catch it: upserting the fr row would find the nl
  page, the GTIN would match, and the nl page would be overwritten with French.
- **`?lang=` on create** (never on update). Without it the fr create collides with its nl sibling
  and WordPress silently appends `-2`, so the page lands at `p-{gtin}-2` while the resolver target
  is built as `p-{gtin}` — every French QR would resolve to a 404.
- **ACF written in a second call.** ACF values riding along on a create that carries `?lang=` are
  **silently dropped** — `201 Created`, fields empty, no error — which yields a page with a
  correct URL and no content that `verifyUrl` passes as ok.
- **`meta.gtin` verified on the way out.** `meta_key`/`meta_value` are not core REST features and
  core drops unknown params, so a site without a `rest_{post_type}_query` enabler answers with
  *every* post; taking `pages[0]` there adopts an arbitrary page, which E8/E11 then rejects,
  turning every would-be create into a bogus "slug collision".
- **WPML detected at its namespace root**, `/wp-json/wpml/v1`. The obvious-looking
  `/wp-json/sitepress-multilingual-cms/v1/languages` is not a namespace WPML registers — it 404s
  even on a WPML site, so detection always fell through to `none`.
- **Detection reports, it does not adopt.** The configured plugin stays in force for writes
  (Python's `_resolve_plugin`): a probe can be wrong for reasons unrelated to the site's real
  setup, and letting one override a configured plugin fails silently.

Deliberate differences, decided rather than drifted:

| Difference | Why |
|---|---|
| **No `delete_media`, and no `wp_delete_media` tool.** The ownership predicate is ported because the dedup path needs it to decide whether a wrong-sized attachment is ours to replace; the delete it guards is private and reachable only from the two integrity paths. | The MCP exposes five tools and nothing in the publish path uses it. `src/server.test.ts` asserts that exact list, which is the standing guard that nobody added a destructive one. |
| **`uploadMedia` returns the attachment id**, not Python's `MediaUpload(media_id, created)`. | `created` exists for the Python run loop's rollback, so it deletes only what it added. The MCP has no run loop and no rollback; the field would be one nobody reads. |
| **Diagnostics go to stderr** via an injectable `logger`, not a logging framework. | This is a stdio server — stdout carries the MCP protocol frames. |
| **`WordPressApiError` carries no call label**, where the Python `WordPressAPIError` names the failing call and quotes the scrubbed body (#71). | Not yet ported. Diagnostic quality only; no behavioural difference. |

**Absent by scope**, because the MCP exposes five tools rather than the Python client's full
surface — listing them is what makes "everything else is mirrored" a claim you can check:
`whoami`, `list_pages_with_gtin` (and with it the `per_page`/page-limit pagination),
`download_image`, `media_source_url`, `link_translations`, `set_page_status`, `delete_page`,
`delete_media`, `close`.

### Re-auditing this

Drift is invisible to CI: nothing in the publish path imports these servers, so both
implementations stay green while they disagree. The check is manual and takes minutes:

```bash
git log --oneline --since=<date-of-last-audit> -- lib/wp_client.py   # candidates
diff <(grep -n "^    def " lib/wp_client.py) <(grep -n "^  \(private \)\?\(async \)\?[a-z]" src/client.ts)
```

For each Python fix since the last audit, decide: ported, absent-by-scope, or drift. Then update
the date above. Both previous rounds were found this way and neither was found any other way.

## Status

Code-complete and unit-tested against mocked HTTP (`fetch` stub) and an in-memory MCP
transport, including every behaviour in the parity list above. The live staging round-trip
(Polylang detection, §6.1/§6.2 idempotency, and the published-page exit gate) runs via the
marked `tests/integration/test_wp_staging.py` once staging WordPress is provisioned — see
IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §12 Phase 4 and §13.3.

**Nothing in the publish path uses this server**, and it is unpublished by choice
(`docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md` OD-2). `lib/wp_client.py` is what runs against the live site, driven by
`flow-orchestrator`. This server is now *safe* to point at one — its writes are gated — but that is
a floor, not a recommendation: the skill carries the whole flow (scope, plan review, per-row diff,
dry run), where this carries one gate per call.
